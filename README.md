# Dynamic Workout Plan Generator

The Fitness/Workout Plan Generator is a machine learning project designed to provide personalized workout plan based on user input. By leveraging data from fitness devices, the project predicts workout intensity and type, helping users achieve their fitness goals more effectively.

## Features

### ðŸŒŸ Personalised Workout Plan
- By utilizing machine learning models, the project provides personalized workout plans based on individual user data (age, weight, steps, heart rate, etc.).


### ðŸŽ¨ Predictive Modeling 
- The project uses a regression model (Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression) to predict workout intensity and a classification model (Random Forest Classifier) to predict the type of workout activity to perform.

### ðŸ“ˆ Data Pre-processing
- The system preprocesses data by normalizing numerical features and encoding categorical variables for better model performance.
